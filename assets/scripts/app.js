//Purpose is to be able to do a calculator by entering a Number and (add,sub,mult,divide) to the last number enter
//Calculator that works with two numbers

//We need Variable and Constants
/*Variable: I is a data container or storage where the stored data will be used to achieve a purpose. Or data container where it value can change
   In JS the format is [let userName = 'Felix';
                             userName = 'Ackuayi';
                        ]

     Constant: With this form of variable declaration the value in the variable is fixed and cannot be changed
                  In JS the format is [const totalUsers = 15;
                             userName =  20; //this will throw an error because it has been declared constant and cannot be changed
                        ]
