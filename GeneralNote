What is JavaScript

1. Is a dynamic weakly typed programming language which is
a.compiled at runtime.
b. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly
on any machine (Host environment)

2. Was created to make webpages more dynamic
-change content on a page directly from inside the browser
- It is called LiveScript
- due to it Java style and popularity of Java xalled it JavaScript

3. It is indepedent from Java and has nothing in common

HOW Do Webpages Works ?

-User visit a webpage
- You use a browser to access your webpage
- You use your laptop with a browser and enter your URL
- When you visit the webpage of the URL AND the webpage get loaded,A request is sent to a SERVER where the HTML file is hosted
- The server loads the webpage and sends it back to your browser in a form of RESPONSE.

LET SAY THE WEBPAGE IS AN ECOMMERCE PAGE
- Let say the loaded webspage is an online shop.
- The user clicks a button to submit a Form (Example: To order some product)
- This will trigger a new request which is sent by the browser to the server
- A form submission is sent to the server and the server will handle the incoming request
- maybe store some order data in a database and once it's done, it will reply back with a new RESPONSE
-WITH A NEW PAGE, A NEW HTM DOCUMENT WHICH IS SENT BACK TO THE CLIENT.
-MAYBE THE ORDER CONFIRMATION PAGE.
-This is how we interract with the WEB

3. JS helps us make this more reactive
It helps us make a webpage more reactive and skip that second response flow in some circumstances.
-to instead change the already loaded page and do something there

4. Created (assets,info) folders and index.html file
Assets folder can contain (images, scripts,styles) folders

Script Folder ->apps.js

Max showed an example where you can load a page within an existing Page without redirecting out of the main page
Example:
1. He grabbed a text within a paragraph tag which was to display as a link to another page
Example
<p> Kofi is going to school</p>

2. He copied the text (Kofi is going to School)

3. Pasted it in an anchor tag

<a href="#" data-text="Kofi is going to School" class="info-modal></a>
<a href="#" data-text="Weekly Meal for Kofi" class="info-modal></a>

4. He added
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>

5. Now go back to the browser and reload. You will see the modal popup.

Finally: In summary JS is a Dynamic,weakly-typed programming language. It is an Interpreted language
That means it is compiled on the fly. It compiled before it runn and not compiled during development

- It is a Hosted language and runs in different environment (EG: Browser)
-Most prominent use-case.Run Code in a browser

How is JS Executed
-Let say you run your JavaScript code
-And you want it to have some effect on your webpage if we talk about the browser as our envirnment where we run the script
- One important thing built into any environment when you want to run your JS

1. Chrome is called V8

2. SpinderMonkey - Firefox

- The job of the engine (Parse the code (means reads & understand your code) -> Compile to Machine Code because machine code execute faster -> then execution is done)
- Everthing is done on a single Thread (handles multiple tasks on one single thread)
Learnt what (Interpreter means, execution means)\

Dynamic and Weakly Typed

Dynamic, interpreted Programming Language
-Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled "on the fly" (ex: browser)
- Code evaluated and executed at runtime
- Code can change at runtime (ex: type of variable)-> Example if you have a variable storing text you can be allowed to switch dataType and store integer.

Weakly Typed Programming Language means : When we work with data (text or number) you don't tell JS what form of data you are about to use.
- Data types are assumed (assigned to variables) automatically
-You dont define that some variable has to hold a certain value (e.g a number)
- Data types are not set in stone but can change
