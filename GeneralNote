HOW Do Webpages Works ?

-User visit a webpage
- You use a browser to access your webpage
- You use your laptop with a browser and enter your URL
- When you visit the webpage of the URL AND the webpage get loaded,A request is sent to a SERVER where the HTML file is hosted
- The server loads the webpage and sends it back to your browser in a form of RESPONSE.

LET SAY THE WEBPAGE IS AN ECOMMERCE PAGE
- Let say the loaded webspage is an online shop.
- The user clicks a button to submit a Form (Example: To order some product)
- This will trigger a new request which is sent by the browser to the server
- A form submission is sent to the server and the server will handle the incoming request
- maybe store some order data in a database and once it's done, it will reply back with a new RESPONSE
-WITH A NEW PAGE, A NEW HTM DOCUMENT WHICH IS SENT BACK TO THE CLIENT.
-MAYBE THE ORDER CONFIRMATION PAGE.
-This is how we interract with the WEB

3. JS helps us make this more reactive
It helps us make a webpage more reactive and skip that second response flow in some circumstances.
-to instead change the already loaded page and do something there

4. Created (assets,info) folders and index.html file
